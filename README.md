## Task 1 - Coding

This code calculates the air distance between the pairs n randomly generated places. The amount of places is given by the user at the start of the code. If no number is entered, a predifined list of places is used (imported from places.csv). Then, the pairs are sorted by ascending distance. Finally, the average distance is computed as well as the pair having the air distance the closest to the averagen. The output of the code is given in a .txt file called "output.txt"

## Instructions

- Download the file "places.csv" and the Jupyter Notebook code "Task 1 Code Test Maxime Bardet.ipynb" and save them in a same folder
- Run the code "Task 1 Code Test Maxime Bardet" in Jupyter Notebook
- Write a number of places (integer number) to be randomly generated and press "Enter". By just pressing "Enter" without writing a number of places, the code will run with the list of places given in the file "places.csv"
- The output of the code is given in the same folder in a .txt file called "output.txt"
